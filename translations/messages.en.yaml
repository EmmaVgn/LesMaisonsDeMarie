  about: "ABOUT THE LITTLE HOUSE"
  description: |
    The terracotta floor and stone walls have been preserved. The layout has been carefully thought out to offer a room where everything is possible: cooking, dining and lazing around. A bedroom with en-suite shower room, separate toilet and second shower room complete the first floor. Under the roof, upstairs, you'll find the TV corner and a second bedroom for the children. The glass-paste swimming pool is very close to the house, and is fenced in for maximum safety. Under the arbour, you can enjoy a meal or fall asleep in a deckchair.
